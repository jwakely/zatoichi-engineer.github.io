### Mandatory Access Control

Traditional UNIX based systems restrict what resources different users can
access by means of labeling resources so only a given user or group
can access them. Controls are discretionary because a given user may be
capable of passing a permission (directly or indirectly) to another
user. An example would be creating a file then marking its permissions
readable by other users. Such a control scheme is referred to as
Discretionary Access Control (DAC).

An alternative to DAC is Mandatory Access Control (MAC). A MAC system
can further constrain what a system can do, and is based on a policy.
Restrictions can be imposed on users, process, and threads, and can
involve resources ranging from file and directories to TCP/UDP ports,
shared memory segments, and I/O devices. When an action is attempted
the kernel will examine the current policy and determine if the action
is allowed or not.

In 2001 the development of a reference monitor in the Linux kernel
started, and the result is the Linux Security Modules (LSM) framework. Using
this framework anyone could create a Linux kernel module which enforced
a given MAC. The LSM consists of a number of hooks which can be used to
determine if certain actions should proceed or should be blocked.

Several MAC implementations have been developed on top of LSM, and these
include [SELinux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux),
[AppArmor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppArmor),
[Smack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smack_(software)),
and
[TOMOYO Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoyo_Linux). Each of these
has its goals and capabilities. This post focuses on AppArmor.

AppArmor is a MAC which allows a system to restrict the actions of
individual programs, regardless of what user executes them. Each program
which is restricted has a profile which defines what it is allowed to do.
Profiles can restrict [capabilities](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html)
(typically available to root), network access, and file system access.
AppArmor is not appropriate for locking down every application in a system,
but could be used to restrict the behavior of certain applications, especially
those which are accessible over the network or handle untrusted data.

### Analyzing AppArmor

AppArmor was analyzed to determine its performance impact on a system, both
when it is enabled with no profiles and when a profile was active.
To facilitate the analysis, a custom Linux distribution was built using Yocto,
one build with AppArmor enabled in the kernel and one without. Yocto version
Rocko was used, which includes Linux version v4.12. The build was
run on QEMU and analyzed. See
[this post]({% post_url 2017-10-02-yocto-on-osx %}#building-with-yocto-on-docker)
on how to create a custom QEMU image, in my case on macOS.

The Yocto build was a bare-bones build with two exceptions: FFmpeg was included
which will be used to compare performance, and AppArmor's tools were
included. Adding these two were accomplished by
adding the following to the conf/local.conf file in the build directory:

{% highlight shell %}
# Add ffmpeg and allow its commercial license flag
CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += "ffmpeg"
LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST += "commercial"
# Add AppArmor's tools
CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += "apparmor"

# Add extra space (in KB) to the file system, so that the
# benchmark has space to output its file(s).
IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXTRA_SPACE = "512000"
{% endhighlight %}

The AppArmor tools required the following BB layers in the conf/bblayers.conf
file:

{% highlight shell %}
BBLAYERS ?= " \
  /workdir/poky/meta \
  /workdir/poky/meta-poky \
  /workdir/openembedded-core/meta \
  /workdir/meta-security \
  /workdir/meta-openembedded/meta-oe \
  /workdir/meta-openembedded/meta-perl \
  /workdir/meta-openembedded/meta-networking \
  /workdir/meta-openembedded/meta-python \
  /workdir/poky/meta-yocto-bsp \
  "
{% endhighlight %}

In addition a dependency needed to be removed from the apparmor recipe, as
the AppArmor tests were failing due to a missing dependency:

{% highlight shell %}

{% endhighlight %}

#### Performance cost

Enabling the AppArmor LSM should involve some overhead as different operations
are checked against the given policy. However, the question is can the
performance cost be measured or is it exceedingly small?

To quantify the performance impact, an experiment was conducted which encoded
a small video 20 times in succession using FFmpeg. See
[this post]({% post_url 2017-10-04-stack-smashing-protection %}#performance-cost)
for details on the experiment and the video file which was used. Three trials were
conducted, one without AppArmor compiled into the kernel, one with it compiled and
enabled but no profiles were enabled, and one where a simple FFmpeg profile was
enabled. These three trials were designed to determine the impact of the kernel
module alone as well as when a profile was active. The FFmpeg profile which was
used in the third trial was as follows:

{% highlight shell %}
root@qemux86:~# cat /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.ffmpeg
#include <tunables/global>
/usr/bin/ffmpeg {
  #include <abstractions/base>

  /home/root/* rw,
}
{% endhighlight %}

The following three [box plots](http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats/box2.html)
show the results of the experiment (raw data [here]({{ "/assets/data/hardening-ffmpeg-data.csv" | absolute_url }})).

![Boxplot]({{ "/assets/images/apparmor-ffmpeg-boxplot.png" | absolute_url }})

The results show that enabling the AppArmor kernel module does result in
an increase of ~3.6 seconds on average, or 3%. The data appears to indicate that
enabling the FFmpeg profile results in a further performance hit, but when the
outlier is discarded the mean times are close, which may indicate that for
a simple profile there it little additional performance impact.

### Conclusion

The AppArmor LSM can be used to provide additional hardening to a system
by enforcing Mandatory Access Controls on a per-application basis. There
is a performance impact of enabling it in the kernel, however the impact
may be worth the additional protection that it can provide.
